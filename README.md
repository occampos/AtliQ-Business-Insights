# AtliQ-Business-Insights

*Project Description:*

In this project I work with data representing AtliQ Technologies, aiming to produce an interactive dashboard that effectively showcases critical business insights. Leveraging *DAX* and *Power Query* in *Power BI*, I organize and present the data in a user-friendly format, facilitating seamless data-driven decision-making. The dashboard is thoughtfully divided into four main perspectives: Finance View, Sales View, Marketing View, and Supply Chain View.

*Objective:*

The main aim of this project is to highlight the capabilities of *DAX* and *Power Query* in *Power BI* to develop an interactive dashboard that highlights valuable business insights. The dashboard is created with the end goal of fostering data driven decision making throughout the organization.
